# Hey there! 👋

This is just my portfolio, nothing too fancy. Just some code and good vibes.

Feel free to fork this, copy the code, or edit whatever you want. Honestly, it's not even really my code anyway, so go crazy with it!

## Run This On Your Machine 💻

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (you know the drill)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to your Gemini API key (you'll need to grab one first).
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You should probably star ⭐ this repo just so you don't forget about it later.

The UI is honestly beautiful—it's so clean you might actually want to lick your screen. ✨
